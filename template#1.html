    <h1>üßæ DEBT STATEMENT</h1>
    <h2>Holder: <strong style="color:#fff;">Spot</strong></h2>
    <p>Reason: <strong style="color:#ccc;">Unpaid PC Subscription</strong></p>
    <p>Due Date: <strong style="color:#ccc;">4 Months from Initial Agreement</strong></p>
    <p class="dept-value">Current Outstanding Balance: -$2,000.00</p>

    <div class="warning">
      ‚ö†Ô∏è LEGAL STATUS: You have not made any valid payments. The PC is not legally yours and may be reclaimed at any time without warning.

    <div class="nika-response">
      <div class="question">Nika says:</div>
      <div class="answer">
        Let me be 100% clear: you agreed to a payment arrangement for the PC ‚Äî but never followed through. You <strong>did not</strong> make the required **first subscription payment**, and no additional agreements have replaced the original terms.<br><br>

        That means:<br>
        - The PC is still under the ownership of the provider.<br>
        - You are currently in breach of the agreement.<br>
        - Legal or physical reclamation of the device is valid.<br><br>

        This is not a scare tactic. This is simply the reality. You do not own the PC until payment is made. No payment = no ownership.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="nika-response">
      <div class="question">User: "Well, what if I can‚Äôt pay right now?"</div>
      <div class="answer">
        Nika: Then the original agreement is still broken. Delays, excuses, or circumstances do not undo the fact that <strong>you failed to pay</strong>. The legal outcome remains: you do not own the device.<br><br>

        If this is hard to accept ‚Äî remember: no one forced you into the deal. But now you are responsible for the consequences of not keeping your word.
      </div>

    <div class="nika-response">
      <div class="question">User: "I didn‚Äôt know I didn‚Äôt own it."</div>
      <div class="answer">
        Nika: That‚Äôs not a valid excuse. The agreement stated clearly that **ownership begins once payment is received**. You acknowledged this. The debt exists because you were trusted to keep that promise ‚Äî and you didn‚Äôt.
